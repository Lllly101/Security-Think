# serialator
Python script to exploit CVE-2015-4852.

## Description
During a recent engagement, I found that Nessus was now actively exploiting vulnerabilities for confirmation. When I checked the associated nasl script I found that the payload was generic enough to be used on a standalone script. Hence, I collected the payloads from all the nasl scripts that were part of the same RCE vulnerability (but for separate applications) and wrapped them with Python magic.
Next time you see a vulnreable application, use this script.

## Changelog:

** Initial commit. Ready for testing.
